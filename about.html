    Who we are

<div id="abt1" class="about">
    <p class="about-body"> ABEG is a team of five undergraduate Computer Science students 
        at the University of Calgary. We aim to improve the quality of life for all students 
        by providing new throughways for communication between students, and providing new
        ways to access some of the student resources already provided by the university.

    Why it's important
</p>

<div id="abt2" class="about">
    <p class="about-body"> The driving force behind ABEG is and always has been providing
        resources to help students maintain good mental health, as well as do everything we
        can to help those afflicted with mental health issues get the help they need. While
        mental health has become a more common concern in recent years, people afflicted with
        mental illnesses such as depression anxiety often have trouble taking advantage of
        them, as doing so can require them to step outside of their comfort zone. That's why
        we're building the bridges that allow people to access them from somewhere they feel
        safe.
